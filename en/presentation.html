            <h2>A. The area of the activity: maritime transport</h2>
            <p>
                With 9 billion tons of freight per year,
				the seaway is the primary mode of freight transportation
				and occupies a growing place in international trade.
				This is an inexpensive way but the routing times are longer.
				Goods can be transported on specialized polytherm vessels
				intended for the transport of perishable foodstuffs or on non-specialized vessels
				(conventional freighters, container ships, mixed vessels, barge carriers for transport
				combined river / sea).
            </p>

            <p>
                Containerization allows the lowest costs and offers a number of advantages
                such as cold chain security, traceability, timeliness, services and
                door to door deliveries. Technological progress linked to packaging,
                mechanization, refrigeration of ships (products under controlled atmosphere and under
                modified atmosphere), the tracking of goods via computerized systems enabled
                for maritime transport to become competitive in the transport of fresh products,
                resulting in lower costs.
            </p>

            <p>
                The refrigerated freight transported around the world relates mainly to meat,
                fish, dairy products, fruits and vegetables (including 80% bananas, citrus fruits
                and others...). To transport them, we use reefer ships
                (a refrigerated vessel), the most economical and least polluting mode. However, he
                is competing with containerization which benefits from the growth of product exchanges
                costs and preferences of customers (including mass distribution) sensitive to prices and
                just-in-time supplies.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, the lack of flexibility in port infrastructure (ports of
                loading / unloading) and its high cost are all obstacles to the growth of this economy.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, the favorable economic context (globalization of consumer markets,
                liberalization of trade) perpetuates the place of maritime transport in trade.
            </p>
